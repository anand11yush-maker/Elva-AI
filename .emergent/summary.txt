The previous AI engineer initiated work by thoroughly understanding the provided context, including system prompts and the initial continuation request. The engineer started by exploring the codebase, specifically identifying the application's nature (Elva AI, a smart assistant with hybrid AI and n8n integration) from . Key files like , , and  were examined to locate existing webhook configurations and the backend URL. The AI engineer successfully summarized the current state and formulated a clear, step-by-step plan to address the user's request: update the webhook URL, restart the backend, and then wait for Gmail API credentials. The backend URL was also provided as requested. The work is currently paused awaiting user confirmation to proceed with the proposed plan.

<product_requirements>
The user tasked the AI engineer with modifying an existing MVP-level application called Elva-AI. This application functions as a smart assistant chat interface, leveraging a hybrid AI architecture (combining Claude and Groq models) and integrating with an n8n workflow.

The core problem the user is trying to solve involves updating the external integration points and providing necessary API credentials for new functionality. Specifically, the explicit requests are:
1.  Change the existing webhook URL for n8n integration from  to . This change needs to be applied in both the backend's  file and potentially within the  for a fallback.
2.  The AI engineer must provide the current backend URL to the user.
3.  After the webhook update is planned/done, the user will provide an updated  file, which is required for integrating the Gmail API into the application. This implies a future task of implementing Gmail API functionality.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **AI Integration**: Hybrid AI architecture (Claude, Groq).
-   **Workflow Automation**: n8n for webhook integration.
-   **Environment Management**: Use of  files for configuration, unix:///var/run/supervisor.sock no such file
supervisor>  for service management.
-   **API Routing**:  prefix for backend routes, Kubernetes ingress.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack structure with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure:**


-   **/app/backend/**: This directory contains the FastAPI application responsible for handling API requests, interacting with the database, and integrating with external services like n8n.
    -   **/app/backend/.env**: This file stores critical backend environment variables such as , , and importantly, the  which needs to be updated. It also contains the  which is relevant for the upcoming Gmail API integration.
        -   **Summary of importance**: Centralized configuration for backend services. It currently holds the old n8n webhook URL.
        -   **Summary of changes made**: No changes have been applied yet, but this file is targeted for the  update.
    -   **/app/backend/webhook_handler.py**: This file contains the logic for handling incoming webhooks and dispatching data to the n8n workflow. It also appears to have a fallback or default webhook URL defined within its code, in addition to potentially using the  from the environment.
        -   **Summary of importance**: Core logic for the n8n integration, responsible for forwarding chat assistant data to the n8n workflow. It contains the current n8n webhook URL used for the  endpoint.
        -   **Summary of changes made**: No changes have been applied yet, but this file is targeted for a potential fallback URL update.

-   **/app/frontend/**: This directory contains the React application that serves as the user interface for the Elva AI assistant.
    -   **/app/frontend/.env**: This file contains environment variables specific to the frontend, most notably , which the frontend uses to make API calls to the backend.
        -   **Summary of importance**: Connects the frontend to the backend API.
        -   **Summary of changes made**: No changes were made, but its content was read to identify the current backend URL.

-   **/app/test_result.md**: This markdown file is crucial as it contains the original user problem statement, testing data, and a summary of previous agent communications. It also defines the Elva AI application and its core functionalities.
    -   **Summary of importance**: Provides historical context, product requirements, and testing protocols for the application.
    -   **Summary of changes made**: No changes were made to this file during the analysis phase.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Update the  in  to .
-   Update any hardcoded or fallback webhook URL references within .
-   Restart the backend service to apply the new configuration.
-   Receive the updated  file from the user for Gmail API integration.
-   Implement the Gmail API integration after receiving the credentials.json file.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully completed the initial phase of understanding the application and the user's request. The existing Elva AI application, a smart assistant with hybrid AI (Claude + Groq) and n8n integration, has been identified. The AI engineer has located the current webhook URL () in  and , and the backend URL () from .

The previous engineer's final action was to present a clear plan to the user, outlining the steps to update the webhook URL, restart the backend, and then await  for Gmail API integration. The backend URL was also explicitly shared with the user. The engineer is currently paused, awaiting explicit user confirmation to proceed with the proposed plan of updating the webhook URL. No code changes have been committed or applied yet; the current state is one of analysis and planning, with a clear proposal shared with the user.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Proceed with updating the webhook URL in the backend files as per the proposed plan, immediately after user confirmation.
